Subject to the terms and conditions of    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>
			<br />
            <p>3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate    as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
			<br />
            <p>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You    meet the following conditions:</p>
			<br />
            <p>   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
			<br />
            <p>   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices        stating that You changed the files; and</p>
			<br />
            <p>   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of        the Derivative Works; and</p>
			<br />
            <p>   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed        as modifying the License.</p>
			<br />
            <p>   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with    the conditions stated in this License.</p>
			<br />
            <p>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
			<br />
            <p>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
			<br />
            <p>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
			<br />
            <p>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
			<br />
            <p>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

			<br />
            <p>      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.</p>
			<br />
            <p>      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise       designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."</p>

            <p>      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and       subsequently incorporated within the Work.</p>
			<br />
            <p>   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>
			<br />
            <p>   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
			<br />
            <p>   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:</p>
			<br />
            <p>      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
			<br />
            <p>      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and</p>
			<br />
            <p>      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and</p>
			<br />
            <p>      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.</p>
			<br />
            <p>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.</p>
			<br />
            <p>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
			<br />
            <p>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
			<br />
            <p>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
			<br />
            <p>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
			<br />
            <p>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

			<br />
            <p>      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.</p>
			<br />
            <p>      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise       designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."</p>
			<br />
            <p>      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and       subsequently incorporated within the Work.</p>
			<br />
            <p>   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>
			<br />
            <p>   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
			<br />
            <p>   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:</p>
			<br />
            <p>      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
			<br />
            <p>      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and</p>
			<br />
            <p>      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and</p>
			<br />
            <p>      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.</p>
			<br />
            <p>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.</p>
			<br />
            <p>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
			<br />
            <p>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
			<br />
            <p>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
			<br />
            <p>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
			<br />
            <p>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

			<br />
            <p>      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.</p>

Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>
			<br />
            <p>   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
			<br />
            <p>   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:</p>
			<br />
            <p>      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
			<br />
            <p>      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and</p>
			<br />
            <p>      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and</p>
			<br />
            <p>      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.</p>
			<br />
            <p>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.</p>
			<br />
            <p>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
			<br />
            <p>   6. Trademarks.

			<br />
            <p>      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.</p>
			<br />
            <p>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.</p>
			<br />
            <p>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
			<br />
            <p>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>

Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
			<br />
            <p>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License.
